# Elevvo Task 7 - React + Vite Web Application

A modern React application built with Vite, featuring advanced JavaScript development as part of the Elevvo frontend development internship program.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Elevvo Task 7 demonstrates proficiency in modern React development using Vite as the build tool. This project showcases component-based architecture, state management, and modern JavaScript ES6+ features, delivering a fast and efficient web application with hot module replacement (HMR) for optimal development experience.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** (99.3%) — React components, hooks, and modern ES6+ features
- **Other** (0.7%) — Configuration files, JSON, and build tools
- **React** — Component-based UI framework
- **Vite** — Fast build tool and development server
- **ESLint** — Code quality and consistency
